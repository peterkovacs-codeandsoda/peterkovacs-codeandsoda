# Procedural Generation

## 1. Programming Like God - Ingredients
- THE Creator
- a set of rules
- (run)Time to evolve

## 2. Procedural Content Generation
- runtime creation of data using an algorithm
- solve hardware limitations
- solve software limitations
- solve design limitations

## 3. Brief History of PCG
- 1952: Alan Turing love letter generator
- 1980: Akalabeth (generation with seed)
- 1980: Rouge (ancestor of rougelike genre)
- 1985: The Sentinel (10k levels stored in 48KB)
- 1985: Elite
- 1995: Diablo (random dungeon layout, random item generation)
- 2002: PCG based asset generator - SpeedTree
- 2006: Dwarf's Fortress - The state-of-the art fantasy PCG based game (weather, biome, geological distribution of materials, plate tectonics, wind and water erosion; full history, world population, races, cities; poetry, monsters, animals, events, cities, etc.)
- 2009: Minecraft - 140M monthly players, $3 billion revenue (Dawn of the modern era of PCG)

- 2014: Elite Dangerous (400 billion star systems; without PCG: 1KB/star system -> 400TB)

## 4. Modern PCG
- runtime random level generation (Minecraft, Spelunky, Diablo)
- design of level content (used in design phase, not visible in final products)
- instancing in-game entities (Left for Dead, Pjueh)
- user mediated content (X-COM, Spore)
- dynamic systems (S.T.A.L.K.E.R. - 1k non-scripted characters)
- procedural puzzles and plot generation (Apophenia, Mount and Blade)

## 5. Cutting-Edge PCG
- experience-driven: player experience as input
- search-based: evolutionary content
- procedurally artistic-content: visual art, music, poetry, architectures
- PG gameplay

## 6. PCG in Practice
- mazes
- cellular automata
- L-System
- diamond-square algorithm
- dungeons
  - Voronoi-Delaunay triangulation
  - rain-drop
- fire propagation
- artificial life
- fluid dynamics
- reaction-diffusion system
- music (Hidden Markov Models)
