# Unity - The Practical Way
## 1. Prototyping | Part 1(Theory)
Provide an initial solution to achieve a specific goal.

### 1.1. Step 1 (Prototype)
- Identify primary technical challenges and business rules
- Identify necessary dependencies to achieve them

### 1.2. Step 2 (Prototype)
- Select a quickly achievable primary goal/feature

### 1.3. Step 3 (Prototype)
- Create the initial Design Document

### 1.4. Step 4 (Prototype)
- Collect feedback from partners, stakeholders

### 1.5. Step 5 (Prototype)
- Update Design document based on the feedbacks

### 1.6. Step 6 (Prototype)
- Implement Prototype

---

### 1.7. Step 7 (Review)
- Aquire internal revision

---

### 1.8. Step 8 (Refine & Iterate)
- if the feature 'A' is rejected, improve it (GOTO: Step 5 (A))
- if the feature 'A' is accepted, add the next feature (GOTO: Step 5 (B))

### 1.9. Step 9 (Refine & Iterate)
- Create/Update documentation about the recently approved feature

### 1.10. Rapid Prototyping
- There are several approaches, which more or less identical
  - Rapid Prototyping
  - Iterative
  - XP (Extreme Programming)
  - Spiral

## 2. Vision
- POC
  - verify uncertain idea
  - not for customers
  - minimal project scope
- Prototyping
  - early release of a product
  - built to test concept/process
  - introduce archetype as a good starting point for later projects
- MVP
  - just enough features to satisfy early customers
