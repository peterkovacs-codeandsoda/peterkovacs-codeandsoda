# Unity - The Practical Way
## 1. Users

### 1.1. User Physiology - a.k.a. Happy Chemicals
- dopamine: achieve a goal, expect a reward
- serotonin: social recognition, mood boost
- oxytocin: love, social bonding
- endorphins: stress/pain relieve

### 1.2. User Psychology
- Survival, existence, evolution needs

### 1.3. Player Happiness
- Trigger one or more Happy Chemical = EZ
- Target one or more Growth Needs
- Growth Needs are unique for every player
- Players are similar but different too

### 1.4. Happy Chemicals Again
- Dopamine: quests, achievements, challenges, buy & get something
- Serotonin: K/D, MVP, team kill, endorsment system, ranking
- Oxytocin: story, immersive gameplay
- Endorphins: story, humorous and very sad plotline

### 1.5. User Segmentation
- Happy Chemicals sensitivity
- Growth Needs
- Age
- Time to immerse
- Budget/month
- Expected income rate

### 1.6. User Monetization Archetypes
- no ad, no money
- ad only
- money only
- ad and money

### 1.7. F2P Player IAP Archetypes
- Minnow
- Dolphin
- Whale
- Kraken

## 2. User Acquisition (on Mobile)
### 2.1. IAP Again
- Consumables = time saver
- Non-consumables = feature unlock
- Subscription = time saver & unique items

### 2.2. IAP Items Perspective
- regularity
- budget / month
