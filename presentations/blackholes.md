# Black Holes

## 1. Relativities - Cold Start

- Special Relativity (1905)
- General Relativity (1915)

### 1.1. Special Relativity Foundations

- Inertial frame of reference (with no acceleration)
- Speed of light is absolute/invariant

### 1.2. Special Relativity Consequences

- E=mc2
- Time dilatation
- 2D quantified spacetime (double light cone)
- (it doesn't care about gravity)

### 1.3. General Relativity Foundations

- 3D quantified spacetime
- it really cares about gravity

### 1.4. General Relativity Consequences

- Equivalence Principle Experiments:
  - Philoponus (6th century): two balls with different weights fall the same speed
  - Newton (~1680): period of pendulum with different masses but identical length
  - David Scott (1971): drop feather and hammer on the Moon
- Gravitational Lensing
- Gravitational Waves
- BLACK HOLES (FINALLY...)

## 2. Paradox - The Fuel of Physics

- Newton's First Law: Uniform Motion
  - No Motion (No Force)
  - Constant Speed
- Paradox: jump off the roof
  - No Force (but I accelerate)
- Solution: warped spacetime (3D)
- Explain:
  - turn off gravity:
    - floating a straight line

  - turn on gravity: gravity wraps spacetime
    - fall to the ground (as expected)
    - time ticks slower on the ground than on the roof

## 3. Solution of the General Relativity (1916)

- Schwarzschild found his radius
